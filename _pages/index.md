Hi! I'm Aditya, an astronomer interested in all the mathematical, computational, and engineering problems we solve so we can learn about space! I'm currently a PhD student in the Astronomy and Astrophysics department at **UC Santa Cruz**, where I'm being advised by Jonathan Fortney and Rebecca Jensen-Clem. My primary interests are in astronomical instrumentation for high-contrast imaging, and in microphysical models for clouds in substellar atmospheres.

Previously, I earned a Master of Advanced Study degree in Applied Mathematics from Girton College, **University of Cambridge**, and a double Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics and Statistics from **UC Berkeley**.

I enjoy teaching and creating educational resources: check out the Expository Papers tab for some of what I've made!

In my free time, I enjoy biking, always having a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) for every situation, and trying to complete the video game Celeste in less than an hour (check out my progress on my [Celeste speedrun spreadsheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gWFdwIKdzrLu4wbeL0z8x4fIxxiGERNaUtC5of7R6O0/edit#gid=0)).
