**Interests**

I'm broadly interested in astronomy as a source of interesting mathematical problems. This includes building sophisticated models to better understand astrophysical phenomena, improving computational efficiency to run hard calculations more quickly, and bringing in techniques across disciplines. Currently, I'm working on bringing these principles to microphysical cloud modeling.

**Research**

*Laboratory demonstration of optimal identification and control of tip-tilt systems*

I started this project in 2019, as a rising third-year undergraduate. Initially it was a pure simulation project, but I came back to it in 2021 to run laboratory tests of my simulations, as part of the UCSC Lamat REU. I published this work as an SPIE paper, and presented it at the 2022 Spirit of Lyot and SPIE conferences.

I wrote a real-time control framework for the UC Santa Cruz SEAL adaptive optics testbed, implemented a linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller with a turbulence/vibration-based physics model, and tested it in simulation and on the bench.
